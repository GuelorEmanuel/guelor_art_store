        <p>My last 4 years have been spent learning about software engineering and creating things, mostly software. My most recent role was at <a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty</a>, as a Software Engineer intern, I primarily focused on their Log Entry Service on their Visibility team in Toronto. I did this while learning on the side as a way to foster growth in my profession.</p>
        <p>My spare time is spent drawing, creating software, reading, studying, and attending Muay Thai classes.</p>
